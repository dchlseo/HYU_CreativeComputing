Collection of some practice problems from the HYU Creative Computing text book (chapters 6 to 11).

# DISCLAIMERS
The code is only BROADLY based on the book, and I have altered the code to fit my personal interests.
So this is in no way the ANSWERS to the questions, so I would not recommend any one copy n paste this code. 
(A+ definitely NOT guaranteed :))
I'm already sorry for anyone who is clumsy enough to use a code from a novice python user..
